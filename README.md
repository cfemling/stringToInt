# stringToInt

stringToInt is a MIPS assembly function that takes in a string of numbers, and letters, and an integer base number that corresponds to the string. The function then converts the string from whatevcer base it was written in, to binary ( which is automatically printed in decimal ). It will also print an error message if the base is outside of 2-16 inclusive, or if the string charactaters are illegal for the stated base.
