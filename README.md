# stringToInt

stringToInt is a MIPS assembly function that takes in a string and an integer base number that corresponds to the string. 
The function then converts the string from whatever base it was written in, to binary ( which is automatically printed in decimal ). 
It will also print an error message if the base is outside of 2-16 inclusive, or if the string charactaters are illegal for the stated base.
This was one of my assignments at WSU.
